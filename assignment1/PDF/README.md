Enter your question (or 'quit' to exit): what is introduction

Answer: The introduction is a section that provides an overview of the topic being discussed in a document. It typically includes background information, sets the context, and outlines the purpose and scope of the work. However, without the specific report referred to in the context, I cannot provide the details of the introduction section in this case.

Enter your question (or 'quit' to exit): what is conclusion?

Answer: The conclusion is a summary of the entire report, providing a brief overview of the problem statement, objectives, methodology followed, outcomes of the work, and the significance of the research. It is presented on page 20 of the report. The research has highlighted the need for reducing the computational complexity and power consumption of computer vision systems, suggesting methods such as model quantization and prioritizing quality of data over quantity. The carbon footprint and energy emissions of these systems have been calculated manually, taking into account the number of hours to train the processor, number of processors, and average power per processor. Other research papers and articles have also been referred to, emphasizing the importance of energy and policy considerations for deep learning in NLP and speech recognition.       

Enter your question (or 'quit' to exit): what are the outcomes?

Answer: The outcomes of the work include the creation of a carbon footprint table for comparative study of various models and the construction of energy graphs. The energy graphs illustrate energy consumption per epoch and per regular intervals of time during model training. These graphs enable inferences about each model's emissions with respect to time and number of epochs. Specifically, combined energy vs time and energy vs epoch graphs for vision models are presented.

Enter your question (or 'quit' to exit): what are the objectives

Answer: The objectives are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the objectives of the work involve studying the carbon footprint and energy consumption of certain models, as well as creating energy vs time and energy vs epoch graphs for these models.

Enter your question (or 'quit' to exit): which references are used?

Answer: The context does not provide information on which references are used in the report. The context only includes the table of contents and a portion of the "Outcomes of the Work" section, which does not mention any references. The section "References" is on page 21 of the report, which is not provided in the context.
